# Qubic-Behavioral-Feedback-Engine
The Qubic Behavioral Feedback Engine turns on-chain actions into personalized behavioral insights using four(for now) metrics: TES, BSS, BMS, CFS and new ones will be added soon. Inspired by WHOOP and grounded in psychology, it helps users understand patterns, improve decisions, and build momentum across the Qubic ecosystem.
